# Mini-MWAN Requirements Documentation

This directory contains the complete software requirements specification for the Mini-MWAN project.

## Document Structure

The requirements are organized into the following documents:

### 1. [Overview](./overview.md)
High-level system overview including:
- Purpose and scope
- Target environment and dependencies
- System context diagram
- Design goals
- Out-of-scope items

**Read this first** to understand what Mini-MWAN is and what it aims to achieve.

### 2. [Functional Requirements](./functional-requirements.md)
Detailed functional requirements organized by subsystem:
- **FR-1**: Interface Monitoring (connectivity detection, state detection, latency measurement)
- **FR-2**: Routing Management (failover mode, multiuplink mode, P2P support)
- **FR-3**: Configuration Management (UCI integration, parameters, validation)
- **FR-4**: State Persistence (runtime state, status file output)
- **FR-5**: Logging and Audit (dual logging, event tracking, network statistics)
- **FR-6**: Operational Requirements (daemon lifecycle, service control)

**Use this** to understand what the system does and how it behaves.

### 3. [Non-Functional Requirements](./non-functional-requirements.md)
Quality attributes and constraints:
- **NFR-1**: Performance (resource footprint, response time, scalability)
- **NFR-2**: Reliability (availability, fault tolerance, recovery)
- **NFR-3**: Maintainability (code quality, modularity, debuggability)
- **NFR-4**: Compatibility (OpenWrt integration, interface types, Lua version)
- **NFR-5**: Security (privileges, input validation, audit trail)
- **NFR-6**: Usability (operational simplicity, observability, error messages)
- **NFR-7**: Portability (architecture independence, OpenWrt versions)
- **NFR-8**: Testability (unit testing, integration testing, field testing)

**Use this** to understand performance, reliability, and quality requirements.

### 4. [Data Requirements](./data-requirements.md)
Data structures, formats, and interfaces:
- **DR-1**: Configuration File Format (UCI structure and fields)
- **DR-2**: Status File Format (INI-style output format)
- **DR-3**: Log File Format (application logs and syslog)
- **DR-4**: Runtime Data Structures (internal Lua tables)
- **DR-5**: External Interface Dependencies (netifd, ip commands, ping)
- **DR-6**: File System Requirements (locations, permissions)
- **DR-7**: Data Validation Requirements (input sanitization, type coercion)

**Use this** to understand data formats, APIs, and validation rules.

### 5. [Constraints and Dependencies](./constraints-and-dependencies.md)
Platform limitations and dependencies:
- **CD-1**: Platform Constraints (hardware, network, filesystem)
- **CD-2**: Software Dependencies (OS, Lua, system tools, services)
- **CD-3**: Design Constraints (language, architecture, integration)
- **CD-4**: Operational Constraints (privileges, timing, boot sequence)
- **CD-5**: External Interface Constraints (UCI, netifd, kernel routing)
- **CD-6**: Compatibility Constraints (backward/forward compatibility)
- **CD-7**: Development Constraints (environment, testing, documentation)

**Use this** to understand the limitations and dependencies of the system.

## Requirement ID Format

Requirements use the following ID format:
- **FR-X.Y**: Functional Requirement, subsystem X, requirement Y
- **NFR-X.Y**: Non-Functional Requirement, category X, requirement Y
- **DR-X.Y**: Data Requirement, subsystem X, requirement Y
- **CD-X.Y**: Constraint/Dependency, category X, item Y

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Must-have for basic operation
- **High**: Important for production use
- **Medium**: Desirable for complete solution
- **Low**: Nice-to-have or future enhancement
